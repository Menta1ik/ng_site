# Why Most AI Startups Will Fail --- and What Enterprises Can Learn

The recent article argues that **99% of AI startups will be dead by
2026** due to unsustainable business models, lack of defensible IP,
overreliance on foundational model providers, and limited
differentiation. While the exact percentage is debatable, the underlying
message is clear: most AI-first ventures are chasing hype rather than
building resilient, governable, and enterprise-ready solutions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Why This Matters for Enterprises

For banks, fintechs, governments, and public institutions, the warning
is highly relevant. These organizations cannot afford to experiment with
vendors who disappear in 18 months. Digital transformation requires
**stability, compliance, and maintainability**---qualities often missing
from fragile AI startups.

By contrast, low-code platforms provide a more **structured, sustainable
pathway** for integrating AI into mission-critical processes. Beyond
rapid delivery, low-code ensures that the resulting solutions remain the
**enterprise's intellectual property (IP)**. This is a crucial
distinction: instead of renting functionality from a startup,
enterprises own the workflows, rules, and integrations they build,
securing long-term independence.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Patterns We See at NextGen

Working with clients across regulated industries, we observe four
recurring needs:

1.  **Automation with Guardrails**\
    Enterprises want to accelerate processes (onboarding, underwriting,
    case handling) while ensuring every step is auditable. Low-code
    offers visual workflows plus embedded governance.

2.  **Speed with Sustainability**\
    Business units need rapid innovation but IT demands control.
    Low-code platforms balance these by enabling delivery in weeks, but
    with underlying code and data portability.

3.  **Modernization without Lock-in**\
    Legacy systems cannot keep pace, yet full rewrites are risky.
    Low-code bridges old and new, integrating AI where valuable but
    retaining compliance and traceability.

4.  **IP Ownership and Control**\
    Unlike many AI startups where the model, code, and data pipelines
    remain locked behind the vendor, low-code empowers enterprises to
    own the solutions they build. Every workflow created in NextGen is
    preserved as client IP, ensuring long-term enterprise value
    creation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Addressing Key Risks

-   **Security**: Instead of embedding opaque AI services directly,
    enterprises must enforce strong data controls, encryption, and
    explainable models. Low-code governance layers help manage this.

-   **Vendor Lock-in**: AI startups often tie clients to proprietary
    APIs. A low-code strategy mitigates this risk by abstracting
    integrations and guaranteeing that the resulting application logic
    remains client-owned IP. This ensures that even if an AI provider
    fails, the enterprise retains the full system design.

-   **Quality & Maintainability**: Rapid proofs of concept must evolve
    into maintainable solutions. Low-code enforces structured workflows,
    modularity, and versioning, reducing "shadow IT" risks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Use Cases with Outcomes

1.  **KYC/AML Automation**
    -   AI-enabled ID verification integrated into a low-code workflow.\
    -   Result: onboarding time reduced by 70%, compliance logs fully
        auditable, and solution retained as enterprise IP.
2.  **Credit Scoring & Decisioning**
    -   Hybrid rules + machine learning models orchestrated via
        low-code.\
    -   Result: improved approval rates, transparent governance for
        regulators, and long-term ownership of decision logic.
3.  **Government Citizen Services**
    -   Automated case intake and routing with AI-powered document
        classification.\
    -   Result: 40% faster case resolution, with full compliance
        reporting and no reliance on disappearing startups.
4.  **Collections & Servicing**
    -   Predictive AI models embedded into low-code case management.\
    -   Result: delinquency recovery rates improved by double digits
        while preserving the system as IP.
5.  **Regulatory Compliance Monitoring**
    -   Continuous monitoring of transactions with explainable AI in
        low-code pipelines.\
    -   Result: reduced manual reviews, fewer false positives, stronger
        regulator confidence.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Closing Thoughts

The AI startup bubble may burst, but the **enterprise demand for
AI-enabled automation will only grow**. The lesson for decision makers:
don't gamble on fragile providers. Instead, adopt a **low-code platform
strategy** that ensures governance, compliance, scalability---and above
all, permanent ownership of the digital assets you create.

    "excerpt": "The recent Forrester report highlights the emerging risks associated with AI technologies, particularly in the context of low-code platforms. The concept of \"vibe hacking\" and the potential for no-code ransomware illustrate how malicious actors can exploit these tools for nefarious purposes. As organizations increasingly adopt low-code solutions for agility and efficiency, they must also contend with these new security threats that could compromise sensitive data and operational integrity.",
